Problem 1: Gradebook Reporter

Create a program that reads student names and their test scores from a file and prints a grade report.
Tasks:
1. Read the student’s full name using getline.
2. Then read their test scores until you find a -1 (sentinel).
3. Calculate the average of the scores using type casting if needed.
4. Use a switch statement to decide the letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).
5. Use the ?: operator to show PASS if average >= 60, otherwise FAIL.
6. Format the output as a table using setw.
7. Ask the user (with cin.get) if they want to save the table to a file.
8. (Optional) Let the user search for a student by name and show only that record


Problem 2:
Math Practice Suite With Github
Program requirements:
1. Show a menu with options for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and
Statistics.
2. Each mode should generate random math questions for the user.
3. Keep track of the number of correct and wrong answers.
4. Let the user exit using a sentinel value (-999).
5. Use loops, if/else, switch, break, continue, ++, --, and formatting with setw.
6. Save the results of a practice session into a file.
GitHub requirements:
1. One student creates a GitHub repository and adds README and .gitignore.
2. Each student works on a separate branch (e.g., feature/addition).
3. Push changes and create pull requests for merging.
4. Review each other’s pull requests and resolve at least one merge conflict.
5. After finishing, tag the version as v1.0.
6. Submit the GitHub repo link and screenshots showing your commits and pull requests.
